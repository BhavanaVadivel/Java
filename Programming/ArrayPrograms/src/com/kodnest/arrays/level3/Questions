1)Write a java program to search an element in the array
(Using Linear Search)


2)Check whether an element is present in an array or not (linear search):
Problem: We're given an array of numbers and a specific number called the "target."
Our task is to determine whether this target number is present within our array or not.
Approach: Here's a simple way we could solve this problem. We'll start at the beginning
of our array and check each element one by one to see if it's the same as our target
number. This process is known as linear search - think of it as taking a magnifying glass
and going down the line of our array, examining each number closely. If we find a
match, we can immediately say that the target is indeed present in the array. If we get to
the end of the array without finding the target, then it's safe to say the target is not
present in the array.
public class ArraySearch
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
//Complete code here
}
}
Class Search
{
Public boolean isPresent(int target)
{
//Complete code here
}
}



3)Calculate the sum of all elements in an integer array:
Problem: We're given an array of integers, and we want to find the sum of all its
elements.
Approach: We will iterate through the array and add each element to a "sum" variable.
By the time we've looked at every element in the array, our "sum" variable will contain
the total sum of all elements in the array
