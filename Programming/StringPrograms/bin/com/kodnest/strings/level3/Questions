1.Remove Duplicates from a String
Question Topic:
Removing Duplicate Characters from a String
Problem Statement:
Imagine you are working on a text processing system that needs to remove any redundant
characters from given text strings. This feature will be used to create cleaner text for
documents, emails, and user input. Write a function that takes a string and returns a new
string with all duplicate characters removed, preserving only the first occurrence of each
character.
Sample Input 1:
"programming"
Sample Output 1:
"progamin"
Sample Input 2:
"apple"
Sample Output 2:
"aple"
Question Elaborated Explanation:
Removing duplicates from a string is a common operation in text processing applications,
like search engines, data cleaning, and document formatting. This task involves scanning a
string and removing any character that has been seen before, preserving the original order
of the characters.

Replace Space with 99
Question Topic:
String Manipulation - Replacing Characters
Problem Statement:
A new data format requires you to write a method that replaces all spaces in a given string
with the characters "99." This transformation will make the text compatible with a specific
parsing system.
Sample Input 1:
"Welcome to the future"
Sample Output 1:
"Welcome99to99the99future"
Sample Input 2:
"Open AI rocks"
Sample Output 2:
"Open99AI99rocks"
Question Elaborated Explanation:
The task here is to replace all spaces in the given input string with the characters "99." This
transformation is common in systems where spaces are used as delimiters, and an
alternative representation is required to handle spaces within the actual data.


3.Display All Substrings of a Given String
Question Topic:
String Manipulation - Displaying Substrings
Problem Statement:
You are creating a tool for a text processing application that requires displaying all possible
substrings of a given input string. Your task is to write a function that takes an input string
and prints all its substrings.
Sample Input 1:
"abc"
Sample Output 1:
a, b, c, ab, bc, abc
Sample Input 2:
"AI"
Sample Output 2:
A, I, AI
Question Elaborated Explanation:
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. For a given string of
length n, there are n(n+1)/2 substrings. Your task is to display all these substrings.
